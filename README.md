## 📌 Problem Statement  
Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System using AI, Geo-Fencing, and Blockchain-based Digital ID.  

---

## 📖 Background  
In regions like the Northeast, where tourism is a key economic driver, ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount. Traditional policing and manual tracking methods are insufficient in remote and high-risk areas. There is a pressing need for a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, rapid response, and secure identity verification for tourists, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

A **technology-driven, smart ecosystem** is needed to ensure:  
- Real-time monitoring  
- Rapid emergency response  
- Secure & private digital identity verification
